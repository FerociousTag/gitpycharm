This homework 4 labs. 
The first lab was 12.7 where we had to create a program to calculate an adults fat-burning heart rate. This was by far the easiest of the bunch. Creating the two functions required was relatively easy.
The second lab 12.9 was a bit more challebbging and took me many sessions to figure out.
I needed to take a first name and an age and increase the name age by 1. 
Figuring out how to request the user for an input of both the name and age on the same line was difficult, but I managed to figure it out.
The third lab 14.11 I could not figure out how to do it. I was able to understand receive the inputed numbers into a list of integers.
However I was unable to figure out how to make the function selection_sort_descend_trace work.
The last Lab 14.13 I was completely confused. The funtions I tried creating did not do their intended functions. I chose to not include this lab as It was a mess of code.
